- **Outdoor gear**: Camping equipment, cooking gear, hiking accessories

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web interface framework
- **OpenAI GPT**: Natural language processing and product matching
- **Pandas**: Data handling and CSV processing
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Azure OpenAI settings (if using Azure instead)
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview
